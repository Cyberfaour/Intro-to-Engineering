# Intro-to-Engineering

## Arduino Sketches and Code from My First Semester of Computer Engineering
This README file provides an overview of the Arduino sketches and code I created during my first semester of Computer Engineering. The code covers various topics including digital and analog inputs and outputs, serial communication, and control structures.

## Conclusion
These Arduino sketches and code provided a great introduction to the basics of programming an Arduino board. Through these projects, I gained an understanding of digital and analog inputs and outputs, control structures, and serial communication. By organizing the sketches and code into separate directories, I can easily compare and contrast different projects and choose the one that best fits my needs. Overall, these projects helped me to develop my programming skills and set a strong foundation for my future studies in Computer Engineering.
